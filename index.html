        <symbol id="m_1"><b>Componentized</b> - Microservices should be very small with a single responsibility and be out of process. This is very different from a typical library where components are assembled in process.</symbol>
        <symbol id="m_2"><b>Message Driven</b> - Microservices should be driven by asynchronous messaging where the intelligence is left up to the microservice implementation and not provided by the messaging fabric</symbol>
        <symbol id="m_3"><b>Decentralized Data</b> - Each service should manage its own data. You can think of this model as the OO concept of data encapsulation. No service can access the database of another service.</symbol>

        <symbol id="why_go">Why Go?</symbol>
        <symbol id="go_f1">There are very few core concepts (<b>struct</b>, <b>type</b>, <b>interface</b>,
            <b>channel</b>, <b>function</b>, <b>slice</b>). Everything else is represented in these concepts. Mostly all core libraries are written in Go. Go compiler is written in Go.</symbol>
        <symbol id="go_f2"><b>Static compilation</b>: Go binary compiled for platform can be run on this platform <b>without any additional requirements</b>. There is an possibility to «bundle» data into binary, so this binary could be supplied «as-is» (not archive that need to unpack).</symbol>
        <symbol id="go_f3">It provides <b>styling</b> guides out of the box. «go fmt» will re-format code so all code would be in same style. So any Go developer can easily read Go code. Also in contains «go vet» command that <b>check program</b> for common mistakes</symbol>
        <symbol id="go_f4">In case of new version of Go is released, and there is some breaking change, «go fix» fill analyze source code and fix it. All changes are or <b>100% back-compatable</b> or could be fixed.</symbol>
        <symbol id="demo">Demo</symbol>
        <symbol id="gcp_st">Google Cloud Platform is used and trusted by over 4 million applications</symbol>
        <symbol id="msvc_t"><b>Micro-services</b> - solution for process, governance, cost of operation and scalability issues, <b>not a technology</b>. </symbol>
        <symbol id="msvc_t2">We're building the <b>ability to fix</b> a typo on a prominent page of your large system <b>within minutes</b> without touching the rest of the system.</symbol>
        <symbol id="msvc_t3">We are promising the ability to <b>maneuver an oil tanker as if it was a canoe</b>, in a world full of oil tankers.</symbol>

        <comment slide="2">My name is Valentyn Shybanov. You can find more information on <a href="http://olostan.name/">http://olostan.name/</a></comment>
        <comment slide="3">There are three simple principles of micro-services. First one - isolated logical-bound components.</comment>
        <comment slide="4">Second - asynchronous messaging between services. But no single "enterprise service bus", let
            service decide the best way to communicate. HTTP/1, HTTP/2, REST, WCF...</comment>
        <comment slide="5">And last one - each service should store its own data. No single Database - that means no DB bottleneck,
        no single decision about relational vs not-relational databases,</comment>
        <comment slide="6">But what is "micro"? Does that mean that each service should be 100 lines of code? 1000? How to
        understand is service "micro" or not?</comment>
        <comment slide="7">I like how Dan North defined this. As long as you can fully understand bounds of service, understand
        all dependencies, that mean that it is good candidate for micro-service.</comment>
        <comment slide="8">So let's take a look what Google Cloud Platform can suggest: First and the most easiest is Google App Engine</comment>
        <comment slide="9">With GAE you can focus on code. Everything else is handled by Google. You write code, Google do
        building, deployment, health monitoring, load balancing - everything except writing code of your app!</comment>
        <comment slide="10">If you have, for example, Java app, all you need is to add single file that describes endpoints</comment>
        <comment slide="11">There are couple of restrictions: like set of languages, that could be used, not full SDK, access to system etc</comment>
        <comment slide="12">But if it not enough, you can use Managed VM: In this case you can use additional features, like
            parallel execution and even other languages (like Dart),</comment>
        <comment slide="13">Still Google take care about lots of things like hearth checking</comment>
        <comment slide="14">OS is updated automatically giving reliable safe system</comment>
        <comment slide="15">So why Go is good for development of big cloud apps?</comment>
        <comment slide="16">Easy to write code</comment>
        <comment slide="17">Easy to run app</comment>
        <comment slide="18">Easy read/learn other's code</comment>
        <comment slide="19">Easy to maintain</comment>
